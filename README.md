# ASM-num-guess

This is a program written in assembly that runs on ARMv7

This program is a number guessing game. You have a finite number of guesses. Guess right and an O will be displayed, you win. Guess wrong and the program will prompt you on the 7 digit display to go higher or lower until your chances run out. When and X is displayed you're looped back to the beginning.
